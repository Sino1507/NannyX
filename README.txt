This the current Lua project i am working on.
The script is for the game: https://www.roblox.com/games/7169897329/Nanny-HORROR
Since i am new to programming for roblox games I chose this game, because it is quit simple.

Important:
-I'm not taking responsibility for any "bans". (The script was tested before and doesn't result in any "bans", but still be careful.)
-Have fun!

Updates are coming whenever I have time.
Bugs are expected...
